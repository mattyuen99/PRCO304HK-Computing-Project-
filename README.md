Project Vision:
Nowadays people have lots of service that is being used on internet, from e-banking to a membership in a restaurant. With more account and password was being used, user may need easily forget some of those that not being used often. While most of the people are using the same combination of account and password to avoid forgetting it. However there is a high potential risk that the account and password will be disclose or hacked and all other service could be hacked as well. To avoid this situation, a database that record account, password and other information is needed. 
The project is to provide an encrypted database which contain personal identifiable information such as account, phone number, password which related to a personal service on the internet. The database will have an application-level-encryption, user need to access the data with an account and password in terms to read and edit the data. User need a set of account and password in terms to read and edit data inside the database. The data will be encrypted before inserting to the database, and will be decrypted in client when reading it. This database will be host on local laptop, there will be a client and database.
User will access data though the user client instead of directly accessing the database. With the database, user can record a service, the account and password that being used in this service. Some extra information is also being record in terms of password recovery. For example phone number, this could be a login and also a key to recover account. Also date will be one of the field since this can remind user to update their password or knowing when this account is being set up.
